 * Don't use BUG() or BUG_ON() unless there's really no way out; one
 * example might be detecting data structure corruption in the middle
 * of an operation that can't be backed out of.  If the (sub)system
 * can somehow continue operating, perhaps with reduced functionality,
 * it's probably not BUG-worthy.
 *
 * If you're tempted to BUG(), think again:  is completely giving up
 * really the *only* solution?  There are usually better options, where
 * users don't need to reboot ASAP and can mostly shut down cleanly.
