* Arm FastModels Translation Module Framework Library

Files copied from [[https://github.com/achreto/fm-translation-framework][Reto's fastmodels framework]] for easy hacking and less submodule wrangling in
summer 2023. Changes to this structure later are welcome. See his repo for more information.

This framework provides a set of base classes from which the generated fastmodels code inherits,
reducing the total amount of generated code.
