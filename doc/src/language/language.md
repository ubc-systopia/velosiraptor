# The VelosiRaptor Specification Language

This document describes the VelosiRaptor Specification Language and its
elements. The language is designed to intuitively describe address translation
hardware, including its translation semantics, state and software visible
interface. The language serves as a basis for generating both, an OS driver
and a (simulated) hardware component implementing the translation hardware.
