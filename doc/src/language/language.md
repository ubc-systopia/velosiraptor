# The VelosiRaptor Specification Language

This section describes the VelosiRaptor Specification Language (`vrs`) including
its syntax. The goal of the language is to provide an intuitive concise way of
describing any translation hardware including its translation semantics,
its state and software visible interface.

Ultimately, the language should serve as a basis for generating both, an OS driver
and a hardware component implementing the translation hardware, either simulated
or a real implementation in a hardware description language.
