# Interface

The interface of a [unit](units.md) provides the set of operations that
system software can perform to configure the translation hardware. Similarly
to the [state](state.md), the interface consists of a set of fields that
represent the API of the translation unit. Everytime the system software performs
an API operation, a set of actions on the state is performed.
